# Build tests

Set the environment for 2022.1 Vitisâ„¢ unified software platform.

Update the xsa path in the build tcl files. 

On a development server open bash prompt and navigate to the directory kria_dfx_hw/k26_testcases/Standalone

Run the following commands:

To build individual applications.
```
make AES128

make AES192

make FFT

make FIR
```
This will create a directory named workspace_<ACCELERATOR_NAME> and generate output files inside it.


To build all applications.
```
make all
```

# Run tests

Update the Vitis path in the environment.tcl line 2. 

Update the RM name for test in line 8 & 9 for PMUFW and FSBL ELF path. 
```
vim environment.tcl
```

For testing RM, run the corresponding tcl in xsdb prompt on board.

BOOT Mode should be JTAG. 
```
xsdb% source environment.tcl
```
```
xsdb% source som_bootmode.tcl
xsdb% connect
xsdb% boot_jtag
```
```
xsdb% source testAES128.tcl

xsdb% source testAES192.tcl

xsdb% source testFIR.tcl

xsdb% source testFFT.tcl
```

Last prints on uart terminal will match the outputs given below-

```
comparing slot 0 output with reference ...
Success: Matched with the reference !!!!
comparing slot 1 output with reference ...
Success: Matched with the reference !!!!
all done
